Accoding to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_vivendi)...

> Modus vivendi is a Latin phrase that means "mode of living"
> or "way of life". It often is used to mean an arrangement or
> agreement that allows conflicting parties to coexist in peace.
> In science, it is used to describe lifestyles.
