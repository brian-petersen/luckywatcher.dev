I'm a software engineer by day and an outdoor enthusiast by night.

I love all things related to software engineering. I specialize in backend systems.
Breaking down problems and solving them is what I love most about this profession.

Outside of work during the week you'll find me bouldering, weightlifting,
or riding my motorcycle. On the weekends you'll find me climbing, canyoneering,
backpacking, or skiing -- one has to take advantage of the great ourdoors that Utah offers!

This website is a collection of random thoughts, stories, and ideas that I have from time
to time. Topics vary from [haikus](/haikus), goals, book reports, to tech. Anything is free game.
