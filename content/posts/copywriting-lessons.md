I really should take a step back and introduce the topic here.
I'll save that for another time. Long story short, I've been
participating in a forum recently called
[The Fastlane Forum](https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/) after reading
the books [The Millionaire Fastlane](https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Fastlane-Crack-Wealth-Lifetime/dp/0984358102)
and [UNSCRIPTED](https://www.amazon.com/Unscripted-MJ-DeMarco-audiobook/dp/B072FL3BGP).
The basic idea is that building a business is the way to make
life changing money. (Along with feeling fulfilled and making a
true difference in the world.)

One thread in the forum that I intend to act on is
[Lex DeVille's copywriting introduction](https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/community/threads/lex-devilles-15-days-to-freedom-make-money-copywriting-in-15-days-or-less.59465/).
He has 15 lessons. Each one has action steps involved.
I plan to update this post to record my experience with the
"course".

## Lesson 1

Focus on others; help them. Be like Jesus.

> Not only does it change the way you look at the world,
> but it changes the way the world looks at you.

### Exercise

The challenge? Really help someone. Actually help them.
Don't convince others you can -- just do it.

I made a post asking what people's biggest problem in life is. A few people
replied. I contacted them and asked how I could help. One girl said she
was finishing her undergrad degree and didn't know what job prospects were
possible. I took the time to discuss with her several options. In the end
she thanked me and said she start looking into some options I suggested.
It was small, but it felt great!

## Lesson 2

Make other STOP.

Get their attention. Tap into their emotions.

Do this with a good headline. Make them stop. Use their desire and emotion.
You have to tap into the right ones. Change your perspective.
Gain clarity about what they really want.

Ask the questions:

1. **Who am I?** - *Target Market* - Young, 18 to 30 year olds, primarily male.
2. **What do I want?** - *Desire* - Fast money, fast cars, to not have to work for money or riches. Freedom from jobs.
3. **Why do I want it?** - *Emotion* - Money and super cars will make me powerful and seductive.

Headlines make them stop and give them a reason to care. Slow down, think
about them: discover what they really want and tie that in.

Example headlines and tips:

1. If it's 3 words or less, use ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
    * *INSTANT CASH LOANS*
2. If it's more than 3 words, Only Capitalize the First Letter of Each Word, Following Basic Grammar Rules.
    * *Big Johnson's Beer & Liquor if We Don't Have It, We'll Get It!*
3. If you can tap into desire / emotion & be creative, then your headline will have more power.
    * *Unleashing the SUPER Ideavirus - Ideas that Spread, Win*
4. Length is based on the headline's goal. If you need it processed fast, then use less words.
    * *How to Win Friends & Influence People*
5. Get rid of extra words. Every word must have a purpose.
    * *Here's How You Can Switch Gears, Downshift, & Drive Into the Millionaire Fastlane.*
    * vs. *The Millionaire Fastlane*
    * **Way less words. Way more impact.**
6. If you can add subtle influence to your headline, such as a CTA, you'll add power.
    * *NOW! Get a FREE Animal Tail Butt Plug with Every Vibrating Prostate Massager!*

### Exercise 1

Help someone just like yesterday.

### Exercise 2

Come up with 5-10 products or services to sell. Consider the questions above.
Discover your customer's deepest desire. Figure out the emotions they want
to experience. Write 5-10 headlines that **MAKE THEM STOP**.

*Will add update when done.*
